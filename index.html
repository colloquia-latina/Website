    <h2>What are colloquia?</h2>
    <p>
      A “colloquium” is a literary form that reached its height in the Renaissance period. Each colloquium is a very
      short play or dialogue, usually only a few pages long. Most commonly colloquia were written for pedagogical
      purposes, intended to teach Latin, a moral lesson, or both.

      Erasmus and other capable neo-Latinists wrote a large number of colloquia. These provide a delightful source of
      high quality yet approachable Latinity in digestible chunks. They are of particular interest for anyone who wishes
      to speak Latin actively, as they provide excellent, useful examples of every-day conversations.

      Colloquia can be enjoyed through solo reading, performed in a group, memorized, used as writing prompts, filmed
      for short videos, etc. See this page for tips on profitably using colloquia as a student or teacher.

    <h2>Where do these Colloquia come from?</h2>
    <p>
      The colloquia on this site are all collected from works in the public domain. We owe a debt of gratitude to ___
      and the __ project at the University of Kentucky, who first started the collection and digital transcription of
      colloquia. Unfortunately, after __’s death and subsequent migration updates to the Perseus website, those
      colloquia were not easily available online. Additionally, they had never been formatted in a manner conducive to
      enjoyable reading.

      We have also sourced colloquia from X and Y.

    <h2>Where do I start?</h2>
    <p>
      The list of colloquia can be a bit overwhelming. Luckily, you could pick one at random and be fine. On this site
      you can search by author if you happen to be intrigued by a particular author.

      Eventually we plan to add topic and difficulty tags to the colloquia, so you could find only colloquia having to
      do with schoolwork or only easy colloquia.

      We also have plans to produce in book form a florelogium (curated collection) of colloquia well suited for
      intermediate students of Latin who are first dipping their toes into the world of colloquia.

      active Latin.
